  <p>I want to focus on the shape of frequency growth. Linear one grows at a constant rate, while exp grows at a percent change. Let's hear the difference.</p>
  <img src = "img.jpeg" style = "width:24%; height:48%">
  <p style = "font-size:100%">"Linear" one sounds flat and dissonant. Each interval being the same might make it less musical and "emotional".</p>
  <p style = "font-size:100%">"Exponential" one sounds a little bit better, particularly the latter notes are amusing! I believe the variation in ratios of frequency plays a role.</p>
